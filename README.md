### In this chapter I've learned how to build GUIs with Python 3. Modules and toolkits used :
* Toolkit Tk | tkinter module
* Toolkit Qt | PyQt5 module 

#### For the Tk Toolkit I had 1 chapter in the old python book and I made that one as well because in the book that I currently have it is jumping over a lot of things but goes into details relaly quick while the old book explains everything simple and goes into details later so it's easier to understand. From the new book I didn't do the radiobuttons & entries and etc. because I already did them in the old book
